                <h2>A Quiet and Constant Companion - Music Video </h2>
                <p>This is a work in progress project; a 2d animated music video worked on solely by myself, <br>
                    commissioned by the artists, Watson & Lockett, to the song of the same name, <br> 
                    <a class="aQaCCLink" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3IJCIuZrg5vMmYt1xY99Wu?si=04d117aceeca4f02" target="_blank">A Quiet and Constant Companion</a>.</p>

                </video>
                <p>As with many of projects, the animation is still firmly in its early iteration, but I thought <br> 
                    it was a good indication of the vision I intend to create, with the overall cartoon artstyle and <br>
                    pacing reflecting what I aspire to create.</p>

                <p>Something I really stuggle with when designing is to take a step back and evaluate how I am going <br> 
                    to create the product I want. Since coming to University I have started to take these vital early <br>
                    steps into my consideration. This is something I have started to realise after taking design <br>
                    courses in my first year of my degree, now that I have the skills and techniques to properly plan <br>
                    out a project in advance, I hope I will return to this animation when I find the time and complete <br>
                    it to a point where both myself and my clients are happy with it.</p>
