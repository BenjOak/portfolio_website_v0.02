                <h3>Snowbomb!</h3>
                <p>Despite being one of my earliest creations during my degree, 
                    Snowbomb turned out to be one of the highest fidelity 
                    projects that I've created to date! It features a start and end 
                    menu, controls, sound effects, a points-system, collision 
                    detection, music and art all created by myself.

                    <br>
                    I have linked the game onto this page, though it is likely if your
                    screen is as small as the laptop I'm writing this on, the controls 
                    will likely be a little finnicky (mostly scrolling the page; I'd recommend zooming out if this occurs). If you do play around with it, I 
                    hope you enjoy!</p>
                <p class="clickMe">Click me!</p>

                </div>
                <p>If I return to develop Snowbomb further, some of the first 
                    things I would do would be to change the values of many of
                    the game's objects, as they are set and therefore difficult
                    to change without ruining the composition of the project.
                    I would then add animation to the characters to add more life.

                    Here are a few more screenshots from the game.
